A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits,
each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. 
In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).

def narcissistic( value ):
    p = len(str(value))
    sum = 0
    for x in str(value):
        sum += pow(int(x) , p)
    return ( sum == value )




BETTER

def narcissistic(value):
    return value == sum(int(x) ** len(str(value)) for x in str(value))
